## Update log

v6.0.0 [Release link](https://github.com/Alumx/Alien-Pink-Blender-theme/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
- Breaking update, only works for Blender 5.0.0 and forward, if you're using previous versions of blender please use latest version below v6
- This is first version of the theme, some things might look a bit different but its 90% usable (there are no huge visual discrepancies)
- Lowered intensity of header pink, its a lot more comfortable for the eyes
- Fixed Node header colors to use same color palette as previous versions of blender


v5.3.3 [Release link](https://github.com/Alumx/Alien-Pink-Blender-theme/releases/tag/v5.3.3)
- Altered bone color sets so that selected and active bones follow the same logic as rest of the theme (Orange=Selected and Green=Active) this should make it more obvious and intuitive which bones are currently selected and active
- Also enabled "Colored Constraints" for all color sets (seeing which bones have constraints is always useful)
