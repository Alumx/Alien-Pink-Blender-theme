# Alien Pink 👽🌸 - Blender theme

If you're a fan a colourful themes, you're in for a treat!

Big thanks to [Miguel Pozo](https://github.com/pragma37) for making a [Theme Editor addon](https://app.gumroad.com/d/bd203ea14e1e159c47c00ecd11e2707f) which makes editing themes way more bearable 🙏

I'll add more documentation later, just download the latest version of the theme and you're good to go :)
